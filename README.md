/*Project 5 - Quotes On Dev*/ 

For this project, we had to create a website using Wordpress, PHP, jQuery and CSS. A particular difficulty with this project was getting the jQuery API to work correctly as we had to do both a GET and a POST request. We also got introduced to NONCE's which added a bit of complexity to this process. Overall, this was an excellent assignment to learn more about Wordpress, PHP and utilizing API's.
